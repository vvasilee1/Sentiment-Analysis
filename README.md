# Sentiment-Analysis with FastAI



FastAI is a layered API on top of Pytorch.This is a high level API that is good for experimentation and prototyping. You can achieve world class results with a few lines of code. It can be used for computer vision,nlp,collaborative filtering and tabular data tasks. Achieving world class results was feasible with the extensive use of transfer learning,i.e. pretrained models. This project is an text classification project that tries to predict whether a review is positive or negative. We use the IMDB dataset provided by URLs module from FastAI . 
URLs  contains popular datasets that are used in research and academia like CIFAR,ImageNet,IMDB,COCO among others
